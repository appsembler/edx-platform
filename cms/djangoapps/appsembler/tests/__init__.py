"""
Tests for the Appsembler modifications for CMS.

These tests may test modules in `openedx.djangoapps` which is intentional to overcome
a limitation when such modules depend on `cms` and `pytest` cannot figure that out.

This is likely a sign that there's a need to refactor those modules with cross-dependency, however
it's not clear how to address that issue.
