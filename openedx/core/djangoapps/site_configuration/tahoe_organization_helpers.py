Helpers to support TAHOE_SITE_CONFIG_CLIENT_ORGANIZATIONS_SUPPORT feature.

TAHOE_SITE_CONFIG_CLIENT_ORGANIZATIONS_SUPPORT is an on by-default feature in production.
It uses `short_name` lookup instead of looking up by `course_org_filter`.

Although organization.short_name is more reliable and faster than `course_org_filter`, the best way to identify
an organization is via its Site UUID.

This module is a patch to the SiteConfiguration organization helpers across Open edX e.g. `get_value_for_org()`.

Purpose:
 - Provide compatibility with the Site Configuration Client.
 - Filter by organizations with active subscription.
